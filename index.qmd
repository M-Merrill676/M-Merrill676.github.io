# Background

I have loved learning knew things for as long as I can remember. Reading new books, memorizing cool facts, and working on home projects gave me my first taste of the many different things in this world has to offer. Coding has always been something that I have wanted to learn because of how versatile and heavily implemented it is, plus it always excited me to think about learning a new language. I became interested in data science after my very first python class and knew that I could never go back.
